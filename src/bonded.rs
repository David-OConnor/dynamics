//! Bonded forces. These assume immutable covalent bonds, and operate using spring-like mechanisms,
//! restoring bond lengths, angles between 3 atoms, linear dihedral angles, and dihedral angles
//! among four atoms in a hub configuration (Improper dihedrals). Bonds to hydrogen are treated
//! differently: They have rigid lengths, which is good enough, and allows for a larger timestep.
